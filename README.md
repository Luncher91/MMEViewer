# MMEViewer
A viewer for ISO MME files

# Testdata needed!
To continue on this project I need data which I can use to test the application. In a best case scenario I would like to publish the testdata in this repository.

If anyone has some data which he or she can share with me or even with everyone, please get in touch with me!

# Aim of this project
The final goal is to have a viewer for crashtestdata which can show all data of the MME standard in such a way a data analyst can have a quick look at the data without switching between multiple tools.

## Filtering
The tools should even implement basic filters (CFC 60 - 1000)

# Contribute
I very welcome every single pull request and ticket. Every idea is valueable and will be answered.
